<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<h3>What is a search algorithm:</h3>
<p>A search algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules that is designed to find a specific piece of information in a collection of data. The goal is to determine whether a particular item exists in the data and, if so, locate its position or retrieve related information.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What is a linear search:</h3>
<p>Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward search algorithm that examines each element in a list one by one until a match is found or the entire list has been searched. It's similar to how you might search for an item in an unordered list by checking each item until you find a match.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What is a binary search:</h3>
<p>Binary search is a more efficient algorithm used for searching in sorted lists or arrays. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. It starts by comparing the target value to the middle element of the list. If the target is smaller, the search continues in the lower half; if larger, it continues in the upper half. This process is repeated until the target is found or the search space is empty.</p>

<h3>What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs:</h3>
<p>The choice of the best search algorithm depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific requirements of the search operation.</p>
